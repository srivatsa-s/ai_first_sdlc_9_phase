**Phase:** requirements_gathering  
**Workflow:** ai_first_sdlc_9_phase  
**Project:** Test Project

---

## Step 1: Review Project Inputs

- **Project Name:** Test Project
- **Project Description:** Testing the fixed isinstance error

---

## Step 2: Stakeholder & Domain Analysis

- **Identify Stakeholders:**  
  - Product Owner (Mandatory Approval)
  - Senior Business Analyst (Recommended Approval)
- **Initiate Stakeholder Interviews:**  
  - Schedule meetings/interviews with business and technical stakeholders to elicit requirements.
- **Document Stakeholder Concerns:**  
  - Collect expectations, concerns, and constraints from stakeholders.

---

## Step 3: Elicit Business, Functional, and Non-Functional Requirements

- **Business Requirements:**  
  - Understand high-level goals for fixing the isinstance error.
  - Identify business value, pain points, and project success criteria.
  - Draft Business Requirements Document (BRD).

- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - Specify exactly how the application/system should handle type checking to prevent/resolve isinstance errors.
  - Document system and user interactions.
  - Draft Functional Requirements Specification (FRS).

- **Non-Functional Requirements:**  
  - Capture performance, reliability, scalability, security, and compliance needs.
  - For this project, consider:
    - Error handling must not degrade performance (>2s response time).
    - Logging and monitoring of type errors.
    - Compliance with organizational standards.

---

## Step 4: Draft User Stories with Acceptance Criteria

- As a **developer**, I want the system to detect and handle incorrect type usage with meaningful errors, so that code is robust and easy to debug.
- As a **quality analyst**, I want traceability from bug reports (like isinstance error) to requirements, so all fixes can be validated.

**Acceptance Criteria Examples:**  
- System throws a descriptive error when types are incorrect.
- All new/revised code passes type validation checks.
- All known isinstance error cases are covered by automated tests.

---

## Step 5: Requirements Validation and Traceability

- **Prepare Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM):** Map every requirement/user story to corresponding business goals and stakeholder needs.
- **Validate with Stakeholders:** Review requirements with Product Owner and Senior Business Analyst for feedback and approval.

---

## Step 6: Document Requirements

- Use integrated MCPs:
  - **GitHub MCP:** Create issues and feature branches for requirements.
  - **Confluence MCP:** Create a requirements page with BRD, FRS, non-functional requirements.
  - **Azure DevOps MCP:** Create related work items and epics.

**Deliverables to Prepare:**

1. **Business Requirements Document**
2. **Functional Requirements Specification**
3. **Non-functional Requirements**
4. **User Stories with Acceptance Criteria**
5. **Requirements Traceability Matrix**

---

## Step 7: Review, Approval, and Handoff

- **Reviewers:** Product Owner (mandatory) and Senior Business Analyst (recommended).
- Launch approval workflow and notifications (Slack, Email).
- Store all documentation in the appropriate MCP (GitHub, Confluence, Azure DevOps).

---

## Metrics & Compliance  
- Documentation coverage: 90%+ required.
- Traceability: 100% of requirements mapped.
- Approvals: Required before progression to next phase.

---

**Next Steps:**  
- Proceed to stakeholder interviews and documentation.
- Begin drafting the deliverables.
- Schedule review/approval meetings.
