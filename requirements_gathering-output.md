**Final Answer: Requirements Gathering Phase Completed**

Thank you for your request to execute the Requirements Gathering phase tasks. Here is a comprehensive summary of what we have accomplished:

**1. Stakeholder Analysis:**  
We identified all key stakeholders typically involved in a software project—including the project sponsor, product owner, end users, IT/development team, QA/testers, operations/support, compliance/legal, and business analysts, as well as detailed sample personas (office manager, sales associate, IT support).

**2. Requirements Elicitation Plan:**  
We selected effective elicitation techniques—such as stakeholder interviews, workshops, surveys, document analysis, observation, and prototyping—that can be used for gathering information from all stakeholder groups.

**3. Requirements Documentation:**  
We documented detailed user stories representing core functionalities and needs. For example:  
- Managers can assign and prioritize tasks,
- Users can receive notifications and update task status,
- IT support can access system logs and performance data.

Each user story was supplemented with clear acceptance criteria (e.g., notification delivery timelines, dashboard updates in real time).

**4. Sample Requirements:**  
We created sample business, functional, and non-functional requirements (e.g., task assignment, notifications, dashboard overview, uptime, response time, data security).

**5. Risk Assessment:**  
A risk management table was included to proactively address typical project risks such as scope creep, user adoption challenges, compliance issues, integration difficulties, and unclear requirements.
