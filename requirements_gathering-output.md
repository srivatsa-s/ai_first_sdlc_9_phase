## Step 1: Collect Initial Project Details

**Project Name:** Test Project  
**Project Description:** Testing the fixed isinstance error

---

## Step 2: Stakeholder Identification & Engagement

| Role                  | Name               | Approval Level   |
|-----------------------|--------------------|------------------|
| Product Owner         | Product Owner      | Mandatory        |
| Business Analyst      | Senior Business Analyst | Recommended  |

*Schedule initial meetings/interviews with both roles for requirements elicitation.*

## Step 3: AI Agent Requirements Elicitation

**Agent:** requirements_agent

- Analyze existing project information.
- Generate clarifying questions for stakeholders, such as:
  1. What specific behaviors should be fixed regarding the `isinstance error`?
  2. Are there usage scenarios where this error commonly occurs?
  3. What platforms/environments must be supported?
  4. Are there performance or security constraints?
  5. Who are the end users?

---

## Step 4: Requirements Documentation (Drafts)

**Deliverables to Prepare:**
- Business Requirements Document (BRD)
- Functional Requirements Specification (FRS)
- Non-functional Requirements
- User Stories with Acceptance Criteria
- Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)

### Example (First Pass Outline):

#### BRD Outline
- **Objective:** Fix incorrect behavior caused by `isinstance error`.
- **Stakeholders:** Product Owner, QA Lead, Dev Team.

#### FRS Example
- **Functional Requirement 1:** System must correctly identify object types and avoid unexpected `isinstance` failures.
- **Functional Requirement 2:** Logging shall be improved for error diagnosis.

#### Non-Functional
- **Performance:** Fix must not degrade existing response time (p95 < 2s).
- **Documentation Coverage:** ≥ 90%
- **Security:** No new vulnerabilities introduced.

#### User Story Example
- **As a developer**, I want the system to handle type checks reliably so that my code doesn’t throw unintended errors.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** System passes all type-checking test cases without errors.

#### RTM (traceability example)
| Req ID | Requirement Summary                                    | Linked User Stories      | Status  |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------|
| FR1    | Correct type-checking with isinstance                  | US1                     | Draft   |

## Step 5: Validation & Review

**Reviewer:** business_analyst_reviewer  
- Review initial requirements for completeness and clarity.
- Flag missing/conflicting/infeasible requirements.

---

## Step 6: Human Stakeholder Approval

**Approval Workflow:**
- **Product Owner:** Mandatory approval of BRD and high-level requirements.
- **Senior Business Analyst:** Review and recommended sign-off.

---

## Step 7: MCP Integration Actions

- **GitHub:** create_repository, create_issue for requirements, create_feature_branch_workflow
- **Confluence:** create_requirements_page, update with drafts
- **Azure DevOps:** create_work_item for each requirement, create_epic_with_features

---

## Step 8: Final Requirements Collation

- Prepare finalized requirements documents after reviews.
- Upload documentation to knowledge base (Confluence).
- Ensure coverage metrics (documentation 90%, accessibility WCAG_2.1_AA, security scan) are met.

---

## Step 9: Phase Outcome & Handoff

**Deliverables:**
- Business Requirements Document
- Functional Requirements Specification
- Non-functional Requirements
- User Stories with Acceptance Criteria
- Requirements Traceability Matrix

**Next Steps:**  
Upon approvals, transition to Phase 2 (Solution Architecture & Design) per the workflow.
